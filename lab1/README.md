This is a comparison of working different emperical one-dimensional algorithms which allow to find a extreme value of function in some interval.
We've compared algorithms such as Method of dichotomy, Golden ratio and Method Fibonacci.
The main threshold for comparing was amount of calculations fucntion value.
The source function was f(x) = (x) ^ 2 + 2 * x - 4
The source interval was [-10; 20]
